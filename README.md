## TypeSpec Examples

This repository contains the code for [my blog post](https://blog.thesoftwarementor.com/articles/2024/07/02/til-about-typespec/) about using TypeSpec for API generation.

For more in-depth example, check out [typespec.io](typespec.io/)

## Getting Started

1. Verify that you have Node v20 or higher installed.
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm start` - This will install TypeSpec dependencies and will compile the spec as you make changes
